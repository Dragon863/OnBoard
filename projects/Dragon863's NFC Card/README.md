# Dragon863 Hacker Card

## Summary
I have followed the guide [here](https://jams.hackclub.com/jam/hacker-card) to create my own hacker card! It's my first time using EasyEDA (I have used KiCad before) so I'm still learning, but I'm very happy with the design looks. It will be used to share the link to [my website](https://danieldb.uk) via NFC whilst also looking *really cool*

# Plan
It took about a day to create the design and artwork. I'd like to order about 25 assembled boards, which JLCPCB says will cost about $85. It would have been great to use an ENIG finish to make the board more gold coloured, but unfortunately this skyrocketed the prices when I tried it.

# Design
Most of the resources I consulted were either the guide, or on google. Having prior knowledge of PCB design was helpful. I also used [fffuel.co](https://www.fffuel.co/) to generate the pattern on the back copper layer of the board, it's a great site!
